An enemy is considered to be hit by the ability based on  edge range - i.e. if any part of your  gameplay radius is within the hitbox, you are affected.\nThe third cast, as well as the Sweetspot for the first and second cast, function like ground-targeted abilities. An enemy is considered to be hit by the ability based on  center range - i.e. an enemy's center has to be within the hitbox to be affected.\nAs implied by the previous point, the Sweetspot for the first and second cast is implemented as separate areas of effect to the main component of the ability. Enemies must be within both areas to trigger the bonus damage,  knock up and  Deathbringer Stance's cooldown reduction.\nThe 'target gets hit' SFX plays whenever an enemy is within the Sweetspot - meaning it is possible to trigger the sound effect without affecting an enemy.\nIn the game, Sweetspot damage is incorrectly displayed as  a real critical strike.(bug)\nEach cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as  Spellblade and triggering  Force Pulse's passive.\nThe hitbox and Aatrox's model are fixed to the initial target direction.\nAatrox's facing-direction, for effects such as  Petrifying Gaze, is the direction he is moving, and not the direction the model is facing.\nAll damage modifiers  stack multiplicatively.\nThere's a small period of time in which Aatrox can't declare basic attacks after casting The Darkin Blade.(note)\nThis ability's damage is calculated based on the caster's current stats and changes dynamically.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Umbral Dash can be cast.
