The only exception is if she moves via  Flash, in which case the range of the missile is decreased relative to the distance she blinked.\nKilling an enemy with the shuriken will still mark the last area of the  shroud hit.\nAttempting to cast  Five Point Strike during either dash will buffer it to cast as soon as the dash ends.\nThis ability's damage is calculated based on the caster's stats at the time of its application.\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Twilight Shroud is usable.
