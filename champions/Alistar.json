The  knockback stops short on walls that cannot be surpassed but the disable duration is not changed.\nThe spell indicator for this ability also displays the direction for the knock back relative to Alistar's position.\nAlistar's  attack range is reduced[ to -375 ][ by 500 ]during Headbutt, to prevent him from being able to attack the target when he completes the dash.\n Displacement immunity will not resist the application of the  stun.",
