This causes the buffer to be cancelled and the dash to fail to trigger as a consequence.\nAttack commands will not be buffered to cast at the end of the lockout even while  grounded.\nIf multiple attack and movement commands are inputted during the lockout of an ability, the most recent one is used for the dash's targeting.\nIf the most recent input is not an attack or movement command, the dash will not trigger.\nIn this case, the buffer for the previous attack/movement command was cancelled by a new non-attack/movement command such as an input for an ability cast.\nDuring Drakehound's Step, a visual indicator is visible to Ambessa displaying the eventual dash's direction and destination location.\nThe number of available attacks empowered by Medarda Maxim are visible as pips under Ambessa's health bar, only visible to the player.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Ambessa is  dashing:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nAll the other item-actives are usable\n\n\nDisabled\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\n Hextech Rocketbelt\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite  Teleport  Recall\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\n Flash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",

Similarly, if the suppression is removed, so is the attachment.\nIf the target resists the suppression by being  immune to crowd control,  displacement immune, or having a  spell shield, Ambessa will not attach them to herself.\nShe will be unable to apply the damage and stun in this case since the suppression was not applied in the first place.\nShe will still  blink to the target in this case.\nIf the target removes the suppression by any means, including with an applicable  cleanse effect or  dispel, they will instantly detach themselves from Ambessa, which causes the ability to cancel immediately.\nShe will fail to apply the damage and stun to the target since the suppression was removed from them early in this case.\nHer lockout and displacement immunity also ends prematurely in this case.\nIf Ambessa would blink inside the  attack range of an enemy  turret, including the Nexus Obelisk, Public Execution will instead attempt to position her outside of it.\nAmbessa will  reveal herself during the cast time if there is an enemy champion nearby.\nAmbessa will search for enemies in the direction she is facing at the end of cast time.\nThis direction can be changed by  Seraphine's  Encore.(bug)\nIf Ambessa successfully seizes a target, any regular movement commands issued before doing so are discarded upon the lockout ending.\nThis does not affect movement orders issued during the lockout.\nPublic Execution will trigger a stack of  Electrocute,  Phase Rush, and  Eclipse's Ever Rising Moon for the suppression application and the damage dealt.\nPublic Execution will not queue  Flash if Ambessa attempts to use the summoner spell during the cast time.(note)\nThe following table refers for interactions while Ambessa is in cast time and during the lockout:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nRegisters input for  Drakehound's Step.\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nRegisters input for  Drakehound's Step.\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",
