The slow may be applied again from collision only until after they have left the collision radius; it cannot be continuously applied while enemies remain within collision radius of the border.\n Untargetable units cannot collide with the border, including Aurora herself.\nThe in-game tooltip incorrectly lists the rift duration as 0.75 seconds longer than it actually is.(bug)\nIt is seemingly including the time required for the shockwave to fully expand. However, the rift and its borders will only form after the fact, so the actual duration of the rift is shorter.\nBetween Worlds'   untargetability from the rift dash does not  destroy in-flight  projectiles.\nBetween Worlds'  first cast is disabled while  grounded or  rooted.\nAurora can still dash from colliding with the border even if she is  immobilized or  grounded.\n Spell shield can block both the shockwave and border collision.\nA pair of portals signifying Aurora's nearest possible entry and its corresponding exit is visible to her at all times.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Aurora is dashing:\nThis lockout applies to both the initial dash and the dashes in the formed rift.\nThe lockout during the initial cast's dash persists for another 0.5 seconds after the dash ends.\nThe lockout during the rift dash persists for another 0.15 seconds after the dash ends.\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",
