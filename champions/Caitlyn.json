The bonus from Headshot is added after the critical strike is rolled.\nThe full damage of Headshot applies  life steal.\nHeadshot is a single instance of damage, thus does not trigger  Amumu's  Tantrum's or  Warden's Mail passives twice.\nSince Caitlyn's Art and Sustainability Update, Ability-granted Headshots are the same as the original Headshot override attack, though what lets them cast at high range is still relatively special. They trigger  on-attack effects (including stacking Headshot).\nPENDING FOR TEST:  Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury, is special cased to search targets with the increased range as well.\nBecause Headshot stacks are generated  on-attack,  Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury's bolts will not generate any.\nThe empowered attack will not trigger against  wards.\nStacks will still be generated towards Headshot when attacking them.",
