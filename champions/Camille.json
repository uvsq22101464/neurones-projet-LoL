Targets will stop at the boundary even after it expired.\n Ekko's  Chronobreak will still deal damage at the hologram's location.\nAn active  Cease and Desist on a target outside the perimeter will cause  Vi to continue her charge until The Hextech Ultimatum ends. She can knockback and damage secondary targets multiple times.\nIf the target  attaches to a unit, they will only be displaced back inside once they detach. The Hextech Ultimatum does not end nor break the bind to the victim.\n Kayn's  Umbral Trespass allows him to cast it even if his target is outside the area, dashing through the borders and attaching despite being unable to escape.\n Yuumi's  You and Me! allows her to bypass the borders if the unit she attaches to leaves the area.\n Tristana's  Rocket Jump does not allow her to escape, but she applies the magic damage and  slow.\n Sett's  The Show Stopper does not allow him to pass through the borders and the dash will end prematurely when he encounters them.\nIf the target of  The Show Stopper is also the target of The Hextech Ultimatum, they can go through the borders while attached to him.\nIf Camille enters  resurrection during the initial cast, the  dash is stopped and the zone is formed immediately.\nThe Hextech Ultimatum ends if the target enters resurrection, but not if Camille does.\nThe Hextech Ultimatum ends immediately if the target is dragged by  Fear Beyond Death.\nThe  disrupt is 'wrapped' into a status effect that causes the affected champion to display the \" Silenced\" UI on their health bar for 0.25 seconds, without actually applying the disabling effects of the  silence crowd control type (functions as an indicator of the target becoming disrupted). This however ensures that the disrupt is also prevented by effects that would negate  silences (such as  crowd control immunity).\nThe following table refers for interactions while Camille is dashing.\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll summoner spells are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",
