This is distinct from  untargetability and there are no known interactions beyond this.\nRiposte's effect prioritization is as follows:\nRiposte will negate effects before  spell shields.\n Black Shield will negate  crowd control before Riposte.\nBeing hit by a crowd control while affected by Black Shield means Riposte will not trigger its  stun empowerment condition, as it itself must negate the  immobilize and not any other external source.\n Spell shield will also prevent Vitals from being triggered by Riposte's shock.\nThe shock missile will be fired from wherever Fiora is after the first 0.5 seconds of Riposte.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Fiora is performing Riposte:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",
