Is the tip of the ability enough to reveal her? Whether it can collide with a minion or not? Just if she's around the exit of the fog of war, and even if she points towards the inside of the fog of war? [24]\nSpirits are classified as  clones:\nSpirits can only be fully targeted by Illaoi's team and neutral monsters. The Spirit's allies cannot manually select it as a valid target for spells and abilities, but they can still do so with automatically targeted effects. (note)\nSpirits take 50% damage from turrets. (note)\nEffects, like runes, may consider the Spirit as a champion for their stat-tracking. (note)\nSpirits cannot be  healed nor  shielded ( Summon Aery excluded).\nThe Spirit levels up when the Vessel does, gaining the target's stats per level. If the target has a resource that also increases per level (i.e  mana), the Spirit's lifetime will increase instead. (bug)\nLike other clones, killing the Spirit awards  25, but unlike other clones it doesn't award  Experience. (note)\nThe Spirit's destination is decided based on Illaoi's position and facing direction when the target is hit.\nThe Spirit is  untargetable while it is being pulled, and spawns with the tethered champion's default model and size. [25]\nThe Spirit's lifetime is sometimes 0.25 seconds longer, while its untargetability is sometimes shorter, potentially causing Tentacles to hit an inconsistent amount of times, as was easily the case pre V25.15. [26] (bug)\nRedirected damage is calculated by taking the pre-mitigation damage against the Spirit, applying Test of Spirit's damage modifier, and then capping it to the Spirit's current health. This damage will then be affected by damage modifiers (resistances and other effects) of the Vessel.\nThis order of operations allows Test of Spirit to deal more or less percentage of the Vessel's health than would be expected:\nBecause the Spirit's modifiers can be different from the Vessel's, allowing the Spirit to have higher or lower effective health, respectively increasing or decreasing the maximum pre-mitigated damage from killing it.\nBecause, while it would be expected to block excess pre-mitigated damage over what kills the Spirit, since the cap does not consider the Spirit's damage modifier, it may cause it to block damage before the Spirit is killed [27], or in corner cases not block excess damage even if it is killed. On the other hand, Test of Spirit's damage modifier is unexpectedly applied before the cap instead of after, with the same effect of potentially causing the cap to not block excess damage even if the Spirit is killed, or in corner cases block damage before it is killed.\nThe addition of the two, causes an increasing difference of expected damage when the pre-mitigated damage is between Spirit current health ÷ Spiritmod and Spirit current health ÷ Emod. (bug)\nIllaoi needs 937.5 / 875 / 812.5 / 750 / 687.5 total AD to reach 100% redirected damage. As per above, the damage is still dependent on the Spirit's and Vessel's damage modifiers and may not always be able to deal 100% of the target's current health as total redirected damage.\n Spell shields may only prevent the initial spirit grab and the slow upon becoming a Vessel. Spell shields will not prevent becoming a Vessel or Tentacles from attacking.\nThe tendril can be blocked by  projectile-destroying effects (e.g.  Yasuo's  Wind Wall).\nIt will only be destroyed and not replicated against  Mel's  Rebuttal.\nThe application of the  slowing missile cannot be blocked by  projectile- destroying effects (e.g.  Yasuo's  Wind Wall).\nEffects that  destroy homing missiles (i.e certain  untargetabilities) will prevent the application of the  slowing missile.\nThe slowing missile will not be fired if the target is already  untargetable when the Spirit dies.\nThe spirit pull is not considered a  crowd control effect and will not be blocked by  crowd control immunity, with the exception of  Morgana's  Black Shield.(note)\nThe projectile tentacle model is linked to Illaoi's model animation and size. However gameplay wise it is not, thus the actual hitbox being different than the position, width and length of the visible model. [28] (bug)\nThe model will stop mid-air / vanish if Illaoi goes into  stasis,  sleep or  airborne, however the actual hitbox will continue its trajectory unseen. [29]\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\nAnd will fire towards the same pointed location.\nIf the target's health is reduced to 0 while their Spirit is being pulled out, and they do not  die (i.e because of  resurrection), then the Spirit will still spawn with 0 health, making it  invulnerable. The target will successively become a Vessel when the Spirit's lifetime expires. [30] (bug)\nIf some effect regenerates the champion's health while they are resurrecting, and before the Spirit spawns, then the same will not apply. [31] [32]\nGrabbing the Spirit of  Viego will make the Spirit's lifetime (the white bar below the lifebar) disappear, similar to other cases in the past. [33] (bug)\nPENDING FOR TEST: Post V12.8, does grabbing the Spirit of an  Oathsworn make the Spirit invisible? [34]\nIllaoi is the only one able to see who's been Vesseled, by adding a layer of watery effects on their model. The Vessel will also be let known it's debuffed, by having a layer of watery effects on its screen instead.\nIf the target becomes a Vessel while  vanished, the layer on their model will fail to be added. [35] (bug)\nThe Vessel status effect is a debuff that doesn't persist through death.\nIf the target is made a Vessel while  resurrecting, some resurrections may cleanse the Vessel debuff, while others will not. [36] [37] (note)\nTransferred damage will apply on-damage effects, such as  Black Cleaver,  Morellonomicon,  Executioner's Calling,  Riftmaker,  Aspect of the Dragon burn damage, and  The Darkin Scythe.\nRedirected damage always counts as single target for the purpose of  Omnivamp.\nTransferred damage will not doubly apply on-hit or on-spell effects versus the target (e.g.  Liandry's Torment,  Phase Rush stacks). These effects are only applied versus the Spirit.\nAttacking the Vessel and its Spirit simultaneously will only apply one stack of  Black Cleaver to the Vessel. (note)\nWhile  First Strike is active, damage instances that do not trigger the First Strike projectile, will redirect close to 0 damage [38], similar to past cases [39]. (bug)\nWhen the tether is broken (whether the Spirit's lifetime ran out or the target moved out of range), the Spirit will  vanish and move to Illaoi's location.\nAn  uncancellable windup attack may still kill the Spirit after it vanished to grant the gold, but without making the target a Vessel. [40]\nWhen the Spirit is killed, it will remain in the same position for less than a second before moving to an unknown location. This will cancel any remaining Tentacle queued attacks, for the target being out of range. [41] [42] [43] (bug)\nThe Spirit is immune to  stasis (i.e.  Bard's  Tempered Fate).\n Fiora's  Riposte can be used to prevent becoming a Vessel if used before the Spirit is killed [44], or while leaving the tether's range. [45]\n Sion's Spirit cannot be spawned during  Glory in Death. Spirits created before Sion's  zombie state will remain active.\nIf the target that had its Spirit pulled from them is taken into the  Realm of Death, the tether will break, but they will not be made into a Vessel.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Illaoi is firing the projectile and while the target's Spirit is being pulled:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Tentacle Smash and  Leap of Faith are buffered.  Harsh Lesson is usable, but is buffered while pulling the Spirit.

(towards Illaoi's facing direction)\n2+ champions: one  Tentacle at 60 degrees.\n3+ champions: one  Tentacle at 300 degrees.\n4+ champions: one  Tentacle at 120 degrees.\n5+ champions: one  Tentacle at 240 degrees.\n6+ champions: one  Tentacle at 180 degrees.\nTentacles may spawn on base barriers. If Illaoi is in the center of a base barrier, all Tentacles will spawn in the same position and stack over each other, making it appear as if there was only one Tentacle. [7] (bug)\nIllaoi's facing direction is decided by the position of the cursor on cast, but can also be changed mid-cast through other effects, such as  Flash. [8]\nIf there are no walls nearby, spawning the last  Tentacle will form a perfect hexagon.\n Spell shields will block the ability's damage but will not prevent Tentacles from spawning.\nIf Illaoi  dies within 0.25 seconds of dropping down, she will spawn buffed Tentacles, but she won't manage in time to buff the already spawned ones. [9] (bug)\nIf Illaoi is near a Tentacle that is about to spawn, it will spawn buffed by Leap of Faith even if Illaoi is no longer nearby.\nUsing  Harsh Lesson after Illaoi drops down will command Tentacles to instantly attack, regardless if they were already attacking. Their old attack will keep on going and will hit while the second attack is on its animation attack. [10] (bug)\nThis makes it possible for the same tentacle to reduce its own damage by having the second attack hit too fast, which is not otherwise possible. [11]\nAfter the buff expires, Tentacles will linger for an extra 0.25 seconds, allowing them to continue receiving commands and queuing up non-empowered attacks, while remaining not dormant. [12]",
