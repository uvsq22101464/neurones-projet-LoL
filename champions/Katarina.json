Movement commands applied during cast time will override the automatic attack, but they may not override an already active manually applied attack command. If no enemy is in range, pre-cast commands will remain active, and attack commands applied during the cast time will be ignored (note).\nIf a Dagger is picked during the cast time, pre-cast commands will be cancelled, even if no enemy is nearby. And if an enemy is nearby, Katarina may or may not start an automatic attack (note).\nIf the target is very close to a wall and Katarina targets Shunpo behind the target, she can blink over the wall.\nShunpo will still deal damage but not apply on-hit effects if  dodged. It cannot be  blocked nor can it be missed while Katarina is  blinded.\nShunpo does not require the enemy to be within targeting range to damage them.
