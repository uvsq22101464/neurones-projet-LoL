Blue spirits (above Mordekaiser) are allied champions while red spirits (below Mordekaiser) are enemy champions.\nAlly spirit\nEnemy spirit\nThe Death Realm is a battlefield that exists outside of the normal realm in an alternate \"dimension\". It exists only for Mordekaiser and his target. It consists of an arena that has a radius of 1200 units and includes any terrain features that would exist in the map of the normal realm, including walls and  brushes.\nThe boundaries of the arena are impassable but not considered terrain themselves ( Unstoppable Onslaught exception), and enemies that try to move out of the area will be displaced back inside.\n Dashes,  blinks,  displacements and other forms of movement will cap their effect range to the boundary. Targets will stop at the boundary even after it expired.\nDuring the cast time of Realm of Death, it is possible to pathfind outside the boundaries of the arena by issuing a movement command toward an area that becomes inaccessible due to terrain inside the Death Realm.(bug)[34]\nRealm of Death retains Mordekaiser's previous current health percentage when granting him a portion of the target's maximum health.\nRealm of Death  healing is affected by healing modifiers.\nRealm of Death does not trigger in-combat effects.\nRealm of Death will cancel and go on cooldown after its cast time if:\nThe target is  displacement immune,  crowd control immune or protected by a  spell shield.\nNote that all of the above are ineffective if they are applied after the target has been banished.\nThe target is a  clone or  Sion's  Glory in Death.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, is too far away or Mordekaiser loses  sight of them due to  nearsight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on  cooldown.\nIf either Mordekaiser or the target  dies at the same time of the transition into the Death Realm, the Death Realm will not end prematurely and will continue until its full duration has ended.(bug)[35]\nIf the target dies this way, Mordekaiser will not keep their stats after leaving the Death Realm.(bug)\n Tahm Kench's  Devour will always trigger this bug if used during the cast of Realm of Death and the spit would kill Mordekaiser.(bug)[36]\nIf Mordekaiser or the target cast another Realm of Death, the affected champions will remain stuck for the duration of the new circle.\nThe previous circle will be overridden by the new one; it will be dispelled to enter the new circle.\n Spell shield will not block the initial  slow.\nThe  reveal effect lasts for 1.25 seconds from the start of the cast time if the cast does not complete. Otherwise, the reveal ends as soon as the cast time completes.\nUpon entering or leaving the Death Realm, targets revealed by effects such as  Ignite or  Ashe's  Hawkshot will keep the  reveal VFX but will stop being revealed.(bug)[37]\nIf the target's  health is lower than the amount that should be stolen, they will be brought down to 1 health. Mordekaiser will still get the intended amount of maximum health.\nIf the target's  health is higher than their  health after the reduction, they will lose the excess HP on top of taking 10% of their maximum health as damage. This happens because Realm of Death first reduces 10% of the target's maximum health, and then deals an additional 10% of their maximum health as damage.\nEntering or leaving the Death Realm will cause all targeted  projectiles to be  destroyed.\nThe transition in and out of the Death Realm doesn't interrupt  channels.\n Grand Starfall will always be interrupted by the transition into the realm.\nRealm of Death will not be dispelled if either of the two affected champions enter  resurrection after taking lethal damage. It is dispelled if the target enters a  zombie state.\nAny active  tether effects (both friendly and hostile ones) existing on either of the two champions entering the realm will be broken (unless the tether is between those two).\nUpon entering the realm, Mordekaiser and the target are  cleansed from all  forced action effects.\nThe cleanse will occur even if the source of the crowd control enters the realm.(bug)\nUnlike the other stats, Mordekaiser does not steal enemy total size; instead he gains 10% of his own size and reduces the enemy's size by 10% of theirs (all size modifiers stack additively).\nMordekaiser grows in size over 0.25 seconds after successfully stealing his targets' stats, and shrinks over 0.25 seconds after the buff runs out again. The target shrinks over 0.25 seconds after their stats are stolen, but grows back to normal size instantly when the effect ends.\nWhile Mordekaiser has hold of his enemy's stats, that champion's circular portrait will appear as a pip next to his health bar, visible to all players.\nThe champion's portrait will ocasionally stay even after Mordekaiser has lost hold of the enemy's stats.(bug)\nRealm of Death's interactions with other elements/abilities (This list might be incomplete, last updated on patch V25.24):\nMultiple Death Realms (possible through a  hijacked Realm of Death or if multiple Mordekaisers are in the same match) spawned will exist in the same realm, allowing champions to see and interact with champions bound to other circles. Champions are only affected by their boundaries and are not able to see the others.\nIf another Realm of Death is cast while one is already active, upon leaving, the spirits from the second Realm of Death will be invisible from the perspective of the players affected by the first Realm of Death.(bug)[38]\n Tahm Kench's  Devour can carry a target outside of their circle, but they will be displaced back inside once  Regurgitated.\nAn active  Cease and Desist on a target outside the perimeter will cause  Vi to continue her charge until her circle ends. She can knock back and damage secondary targets multiple times.\nChampions inside the Death Realm continue gaining  gold and  experience from any source, which includes nearby and global bounties as well as neutral buffs.\nStructures exist in all realms at the same time.  Turrets will behave normally as if all units were in the same realm.\nJungle plants ( Blast Cone,  Honeyfruit,  Scryer's Bloom) will not take presence between realms.\nThe  Blast Cone's landing indicator will still be visible while in the Death Realm and within its range.(bug)[39]\nEpic  monsters, with the exception of  Voidgrub's, will be visible for a brief moment after entering the Death Realm, but they will be untargetable.(bug)[40]\n Hex-gates on  Hextech Rift will not be present between realms.\n Eye of the Herald and  Teleport are disabled while in the Death Realm.\nControllable pets and  clones can still be commanded between realms.\nMordekaiser will be given gold, if applicable, for  pets killed at the end of Realm of Death.\n Illaoi's  Tentacles will not be killed at the end of Realm of Death.(note)\n Annie's  Tibbers,  Heimerdinger's  H-28Q Apex Turret,  Ivern's  Daisy and  Yorick's  Maiden are considered as \"large pets\" for the purposes of this ability and will follow their respective  champions between realms.\nIf Mordekaiser dies inside of Death Realm while his  Darkness Rise is hitting any of these pets, Darkness Rise will keep affecting the pets until they die or Darkness Rise deactivates normally.(bug)[41]\nSwitching realms detaches all  attached champions on either of the two champions entering the realm.\nThe allied health, resource, and ultimate indicators (champion portraits located on the screen) will not update between realms as the players have no  vision of them.\nPings used in the Death Realm will appear in the chat and mini-map, but will not appear in the map.(note)\nAny spawned terrain while in the Death Realm will remain inside until expired.
