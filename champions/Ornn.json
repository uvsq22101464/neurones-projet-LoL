The player can quickly forge one of the recommended items by  clicking on its portrait or via the Champion Specific Interaction hotkeys (default: Shift+F1:F5).\nMasterwork items inherit all properties of their pre-upgrade version, including the cooldowns of their effects. Internally, they are handled through an item modifier. An upgraded item gains the (Masterwork) descriptor next to its name in tooltips as well as a special Masterwork frame overlay on the item's icon itself, both indicating the application of Living Forge's modifier.\nStatistics' gold value for Masterwork item purposes is shown in the following table. The table also indicates all upgradeable stats.\n 31.25 per 1 point of ability haste.\n 20 per 1 point of ability power.\n 35 per 1 point of attack damage.\n 30 per 1% of attack speed.\n 20 per 1 point of armor.\n 18 per 1 point of magic resistance.\n1 point of health has a variable  gold value, based on the number of upgradeable stats that exist on the item:\nIf health is the item's only upgradeable stat, it receives +375 health and health is valued at  2.6 per point.\nIf the item has health and only one other upgradeable stat, it receives +185 health and health is valued at  2.702 per point.\nIf the item has health and two other upgradeable stats, it receives +125 health and health is valued at  2.6 per point.\nIf the item has health and three other upgradeable stats, it receives +90 health and health is valued at  2.7 per point.\nWhile not currently possible, if an item has no upgradeable stats,  1000 worth of health (valued at  2.6 per point) is added to the item.[2]\nDecimal values are not displayed for stats in Masterwork items' tooltips, but they are still granted as normal.\nHealth and mana items built on the field will retain Ornn's previous health and mana percentage. Returning to base still brings health and mana back to full.\nIf Ornn starts upgrading an ally's item and said ally enters Herald's charge, the ally will not receive a masterwork item, Ornn cannot upgrade an item for the ally again and Ornn will still receive the 4% unique ally upgrade bonus for his passive.\nOrnn's basic attacks against  Brittle enemies will end the duration of the debuff on-hit prematurely even if the  knock back is not applied.\nHis basic attacks against  Brittle epic  monsters will still render the debuff without the  knock back being applied against them.\n Brittle's  Tenacity reduction will benefit all applicable types of  crowd control, not just  immobilizes. The following do not consume Brittle but benefit from the reduction:  blinds,  cripples,  disarms,  grounding,  silences, and  slows.\n Spell shield will block both the knock back and the bonus damage from Ornn's empowered  brittle attack.\nThe bonus magic damage inflicted by Brittle is credited to Ornn, and benefits from his  magic penetration.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Ornn is  channeling:\nAll of Ornn's actions are disabled during the first 0.5 seconds of the channel.\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nInterrupts\n\n\nAbilities\n\nInterrupts\n\n\nMovement\n\nInterrupts\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Hextech Rocketbelt\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nAll item-actives not specified above interrupt\n\n\nConsumables\n\nInterrupts\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nAll summoner spells interrupt\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDamaging effectsDeath Cast-inhibiting effects",
