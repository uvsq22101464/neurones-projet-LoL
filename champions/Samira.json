When the empowered attack begins, Daredevil Impulse's cooldown is applied on the target which also prevents her from initiating the dash and the attack again on them for the duration.\nThe on-target cooldown will start even if the empowered attack is parried.\nWhile  grounded or  rooted, Samira cannot  dash into range to use the empowered attack. She can only use it if her target is within her  attack range while under this condition.\nThe empowered attack will not apply the knock up against  suspended enemies.\nThe empowered attack will only apply the knock up if the target is still  immobilized or  airborne upon being hit. It will not apply if they are no longer disabled when hit.\nThe empowered attack cannot be used against a target with a  spell shield.\nThe application of the  knock up effect can occur on any of the bolts of the empowered attack if it had not already occurred on the first.\nA missile that is parried by  Riposte or is  dodged,  blocked, or misses while Samira is  blinded cannot apply the knock up in any way.\nThe empowered attack's speed is unaffected by  attack speed modifiers.\nIf Samira is outside maximum initiation range for the dash when targeting an immobilized target, the player must input a new Attack order on the target upon entering initiation range in order to actually initiate the dash.\nHowever if Samira enters the bolts' cast range via her movement while the target is still immobilized without issuing any other commands, the empowered attack will cast without requiring a new order (without the dash).\nThe empowered attack removes any forced movement affecting the target once its knock up ends.(note)\nPENDING FOR TEST: Does this also happen if it's  cleansed.",
