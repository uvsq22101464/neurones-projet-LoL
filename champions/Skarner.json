        "notes": "General\nThe empowered attacks can be parried and will not trigger the area of effect if either the target  blocks or  dodges the attack, or if the attacks miss while Skarner is  blinded.\nThe attacks will be still consumed in all cases regardless.\nNote that if the main target is not blocking or dodging, then the area of effect can still deal damage to those who do.\nCasting Shattered Earth  resets Skarner's basic attack timer.\nThe empowered attacks have an  uncancellable windup against champions, minions, and turrets only.\nEditor's Note: Prior to Patch 14.9, the windup was uncancellable regardless of the target's type. It is currently unknown if the change was intentional or not, but seems to be partially intentional based on observation.\nEmpowered attacks against other units can be  interrupted by crowd control or casting  Ixtal's Impact, but not by issuing movement commands.\nThe aforementioned unit types, as well as monsters, inhibitors, and the nexus are considered \"valid\" for Shattered Earth and will only trigger its effects when the main target was one of those. This includes:\nTriggering the damaging area of effect,\nRefreshing the duration when an empowered attack has begun,\nand consume empowered attacks only when they landed. (This way the attacks are not consumed when the target died beforehand.)\nAttacking any other units will cause Skarner to use his normal basic attacks instead while Shattered Earth is expiring (but still benefit from the increased attack speed and range).\nTo be more precise about Ixtal's Impact's duration pause, it adds 0.25 seconds to the duration every 0.25 seconds, but will set it to an estimated minimum of 1.5 seconds if it would have been lower.\nThe  slow applied by Shattered Earth is a generic slow debuff.\nOnly the third hit of Shattered Earth triggers  Tear of the Goddess and  Archangel's Staff's manaflow.\nInteractions & Other\nThe attack reset will not save time if Skarner possesses sufficiently high attack speed because of the ability's 0.35 seconds cast time. Starting from around  271.4285% bonus attack speed, basic attacking is fast enough to match the time with the reset and will be even faster with more, causing Shattered Earth to actually slow down the user at that point.\nHowever, this only takes attack speed into account and ignores various other factors, such as the damage and other bonuses from the ability and the fact that Skarner generally does not like building such high amounts of attack speed. Additionally, attempting to do the attack reset at such high attack speed is already a hard task, if not requires frame perfect execution to save any ticks worth of time.\nKnown issues\nSkarner's attack speed is not immediately updated upon casting Shattered Earth. Beginning the first attack shortly after casting results in an attack that does not benefit from the attack speed granted by the ability.\nIf Upheaval hits an enemy while a new instance of Shattered Earth is active, Shattered Earth's effects are immediately lost.\nWhile Shattered Earth is active, it will not benefit from cooldown refund effects such as  Transcendence or  Navori Flickerblade's Transcendence.\nEditor's Note: This is not a Skarner-specific issue. Various abilities, including Ultimates, that grant a different ability in their slot after activation may suffer from this problem (e.g.  Briar's  Blood Frenzy and  Snack Attack) and may be fixed or may have been fixed on a case-by-case basis.\nThe empowered attacks lack spell effects as they deal  proc damage, which does not match with how empowered attacks supposed to behave in general.\nEditor's Note: This is possibly a band-aid fix to avoid an issue where Shattered Earth would trigger various effects twice per attack instead of once, as it could be seen during the first PBE deploy of the rework's release, after which the ability was changed from spell damage to proc.\nThe buff used for Shattered Earth is fuzzy. Each attack removes 1 stack on a delay of up to 0.25 seconds. This has no known side effects currently.\nThe slow is also applied and removed in a fuzzy manner, meaning that sometimes it may last shorter or longer than intended, depending on the ticks.",

If he was at 950 movement speed, his total movement speed is set to the cap of 1150.\nSkarner gains a slightly larger field of view during Ixtal's Impact's charge.\nIxtal's Impact's attachment depends on the application of the  suppression; if the suppression is not applied, neither is the attachment.

Skarner will not attach them to himself, causing the charge to end instantly. The collision's damage is special-cased to still apply to a target under these effects immediately upon contact.\nIf the target removes the suppression by any means, including with an applicable  cleanse effect or  dispel, they will detach themselves from Skarner immediately which forces the charge to end instantly and not apply any damage.\nSkarner can move up to 550 units beyond the outer-edge of the battlefield with the charge.\nOnce he has surpassed this boundary, Ixtal's Impact ends immediately and Skarner is moved to the nearest valid space.\nIxtal's Impact can interact with player-generated terrain.\nIf Skarner is inside terrain when the effect ends, he will be moved to the nearest valid space.\nEnemies cannot see Skarner while he is inside terrain, unless they grant sight into the area of terrain he is inside (such as with  Hawkshot or  Heightened Senses) or have  unobstructed vision.\nHowever, enemies will be notified when Skarner is inside nearby terrain while within a certain distance of him.
