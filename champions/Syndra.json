For example,  Annie's  Tibbers will continue to inflict burn damage on surrounding units while being held.\nGrabbing a  Dark Sphere will cause the duration on it to refresh, but only on the first cast, not when it is thrown.\nForce of Will has additional effects when targeting the  Blue Sentinel and  Red Brambleback. Throwing the former will refund 10  mana to Syndra upon cast and will reduce the  cooldown of Force of Will by 1 second, while throwing the latter will apply the  Crest of Cinders burn to any affected units in the area of effect.\nForce of Will's first cast uses a  modified icon while it has the  Transcendent bonus.",

However, their duration will still get reset.\nA Dark Sphere summoned very shortly before Unleashed Power will be used as one of the spheres that get thrown.\nDepending on how many spheres are on the map and how far away the enemy is upon casting Unleashed Power it is possible that Syndra would conjure the sphere behind her as if she was going to throw it, but she won't.\nUnleashed Power will not add a Sphere that Syndra is holding with  Force of Will.\nSpheres that are being pushed by  Scatter the Weak (normally ones that were made late during the push) will not get picked up for Unleashed Power.\n Spell shield will only block the damage of a single sphere.",
