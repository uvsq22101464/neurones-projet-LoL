Thresh will only tug if the target remains  stunned and he has not casted Deathly Leap.\nThresh will not tug his hook at all if the stun was not applied to the target.\nThese displacements will not be resisted by  displacement immunity or  crowd control immunity.(note)\nThe first tug occurs after the 0.1-second delay, while the second tug occurs after 0.7 seconds of the target being stunned (or 0.6 seconds from the end of the initial delay).\nThe initial  airborne debuff that is applied to the target upon hitting them is removed if the displacement from the first pull is interrupted.\nThe target will not be pulled with the tugs if they are too close to Thresh.\nDeath Sentence cannot be recast while  grounded or  rooted.\nDeath Sentence can be recast even while the target is  untargetable.\nDeath Sentence will not  stun enemies that are  displacement immune or  immune to crowd control but the target will still be marked and Thresh is still granted the ability to recast for his dash.\n Spell shield will block all of Death Sentence's effects, including the mark as well as prevent the cooldown reduction.\nDeath Sentence's  stun duration is affected by  tenacity but the mark will always persist for 1.5 seconds, unless the target uses a  cleansing effect, in which case the mark is removed.\nDeath Sentence's  stun will persist even if Thresh dies before the duration ends. The tugs will not occur as Thresh is not alive.\nThe reveal lingers for 0.05 seconds after it ends.\nDeathly Leap has a maximum cast range of ~3000 units. If Thresh or the target move a greater distance than this away from one another while the target is marked, Deathly Leap can still be cast but will fail to trigger the dash.(bug)\nThresh will turn his facing direction towards the cast direction only after Death Sentence's cast is complete.\nIf Thresh is facing more than 90° away from the cast direction in either direction, he will turn to face exactly 90° away from the cast direction over the cast time, then turn towards the cast direction when the missile is fired.\nIf Thresh is facing less than 90° away from the cast direction, he will keep his facing direction until the missile is fired.\nThis prevents the enemy from knowing where exactly Thresh is aiming at before the cast animation is complete.\nDeath Sentence triggers on-cast effects (such as  Spellblade and triggering  Force Pulse's passive) once at the start of the cast, and once at the end of the cast. It may trigger on-cast effects a third time when casting Deathly Leap.\nThis is because a separate spell is cast to prevent Thresh from facing towards the target direction immediately, which is (incorrectly) flagged to trigger on-cast effects.(bug)\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",

This wall is chosen by starting at the wall in front of and to the right of Thresh's facing direction on cast, and progressing clockwise.\nThe corners of The Box are placed 400 units around Thresh.\nEach wall is 470.228 units long.\nEach wall passes 323.607 units from the center of The Box at the closest approach (ignoring its width).\nAs a regular pentagon, The Box has an angle of 72° between each corner.\nThresh can see if the walls of The Box are broken even if they are not within  sight.",
