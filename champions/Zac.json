Note that this often confuses players who are trying to secure  monsters via  Smite while Zac is slamming the wanted target, resulting in Smite dealing no damage to it. It is currently unknown whatever the side effects of this feature are intentional or not.\n Spell shield's interactions with Stretching Strikes:\nThe first Stretching Strike will have its damage, slow, and tether application all blocked.\nIf as the primary target and affected by the tether already from the first Stretching Strike:\nThe damage and slow from the empowered attack if targeted again by the second Stretching Strike will be blocked.\nThe damage, slow, stun, and knock up from the impact of the second Stretching Strike hitting a different target will all be blocked, but not the root and the displacement.\nIf as the primary target of the second Stretching Strike, the root will be blocked, but the displacement, damage, slow, stun, and knock up afterwards will not.(note)\nIf as the secondary target of the impact, the damage and slow will be blocked.\nIf the tethered target is  untargetable during the second Stretching Strike via basic attack, they are completely unaffected by the ability.\n Displacement immunity will also resist the application of the  stun.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away during the empowered attack's cast time, it is cancelled but not consumed.\nIf either target dies while being displaced towards the other, no slam occurs.(note)\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",
