Once he has swapped places, he will then throw the shuriken that the  Shadow would have thrown instead.\nZed will cast  Razor Shuriken as he normally would from the new location, but over the remaining cast time and towards the same point of cast.\nThe  Shadow will not throw a shuriken from its new location, but will continue to play the cast animation for  Razor Shuriken.\nThis special interaction does not occur with the swap recast of  Death Mark; the recast will be buffered if used during  Razor Shuriken's cast.\nZed will swap places with the  Shadow by all means if he buffers Living Shadow's recast during its dash.(note)\nLiving Shadow cannot be recast while Zed is marking his target with  Death Mark, but may still be recast if it was buffered.(bug)\nIf Zed casts Living Shadow while a non- Death Mark Shadow is already present, the previous Shadow will instantly disappear.\nIf a  Shadow expires while in the cast time of  Razor Shuriken, the mimicked cast will be cancelled.\n Shadows will cast  Shadow Slash independently of being in  Razor Shuriken's cast time or not.(note)\n Shadows spawned from Living Shadow may sometimes last for up to an additional 0.25 seconds.(bug)\n Shadows will not disappear when Zed dies.(bug)",
