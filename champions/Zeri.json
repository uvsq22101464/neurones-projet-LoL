This does include jungle plants, structures, and wards.\nWards will only be hit once by Burst Fire. Stealthed wards and traps will not be hit.\nChampion-summoned units behave differently depending on the unit.\n Gangplank's  Powder Keg and  Yorick's  Dark Procession are hit only once by Burst Fire, and any subsequent rounds not empowered by  Spark Surge will stop upon reaching the same object.\n Kalista's  Sentinel is hit only once by Burst Fire, but any subsequent rounds will continue to travel through the Sentinel.\nIf Burst Fire hits an enemy while Zeri is not visible to enemies, the area around her (400 units) will be revealed for 4.5 seconds.\nBurst Fire rolls  critical strike for all rounds as well as the additional physical damage dealt when Zeri is  Overcharged.\nBurst Fire is parried by  dodge and  block.\n Blind causes Burst Fire to cast in a random direction.
